// Notes for May 21
// going over the blog Calvin posted
// set up all routes first, then set up controllers (or maybe some later)
// then wire up services (factory. it will take
	// a name and a callback)
// line 5 of services.js is empty object param
// all routes, then each controller and service "at a time"
//PostSvc.show  would call the GET, for example
// controller - service - html (I think that's the workflow)
// HW: finish shopping cart with CRUD and everything else
	// basically products are like blog posts. Use CRUD
	// on adding products, putting in and out of shopping cart
